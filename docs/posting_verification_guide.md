# SocialFlow AI - How to Verify Automated Posting

## 1. Reddit
- Use Reddit API (PRAW) or the Reddit website to check for recently created posts in target subreddits.
- Search subreddit for post titles matching your content.
- Confirm presence of new submissions with expected content or titles.
- Parse JSON logs from `content_queue/reddit_queue.json` and match with live posts.

## 2. Telegram
- Use Telethon or Telegram Web to read last 50 messages in target groups or channels.
- Check messages for expected keywords or unique hashtags posted by the bot.
- Use Telegram’s web interface or official apps and look for recent bot activity.

## 3. Threads
- Manually visit Threads for tracked hashtags.
- Use browser automation logs (`logs/`) for post URLs generated by automation.
- Monitor engagement metrics (likes, replies) on posted threads.

## 4. Instagram
- Use `instagrapi` or Instagram’s web interface to list recent comments on target posts.
- Search for unique phrases or timestamps matching your bot's comments.
- Validate comment IDs and user handles.

## 5. Execution Logs
- Review `/EXECUTION_LOG.md` and log files `daily_execution.log` or `enhanced_daily_execution.log` for success rates and errors.
- Look for any error messages or rate-limit warnings.

## 6. Status Checker Utility
- A utility script `utils/posting_status.py` is included for programmatic verification.
- Instantiate checker with credentials and use methods:
  - `check_reddit_post(subreddit, title)`
  - `check_telegram_message(chat_id, content_substr)`
  - `check_instagram_comment(post_shortcode, comment_substr)`

## 7. Testing Tips
- Run `python executors/master_executor.py --test` to verify platform authentication.
- Run `python deployment/enhanced_run_daily.py --test-llm` to test content generation providers.
- Generate and execute a test batch, then manually cross-check posts/comments live.

## 8. Monitoring
- Set up monitoring scripts to alert on failed posting attempts or account restrictions.
- Use browser screenshots (if enabled) to confirm UI interactions.
